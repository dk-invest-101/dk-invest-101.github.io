Today, you can invest with your bank or a dedicated Investment Platform. They may provide all sorts of investment accounts ("Aktiesparekonto", Saving Accounts, ...) or investment products.

There's a significant price difference depending on the bank or investment platform you use for trading. With Investment Platforms, we mean platforms that provide only investment services such as [Saxo](https://www.home.saxo/) or [Nordnet](https://www.nordnet.dk)

From [7. Costs of Investing#Costs associated with Investing](https://dk-invest-101.github.io/Costs%20of%20Investing) we've seen brokerage, custody and foreign exchange fees.

Traditionally, banks are known to be more expensive compared to pure Investment Platforms like [Saxo](https://www.home.saxo/) or [Nordnet](https://www.nordnet.dk). The latter ones don't have Custody fees, meaning you only pay Brokerage and, if applicable, Foreign Exchange fees.

The Danish internet has battled for a long time which Investment Platform is better. Saxo has the clear advantage that it provides a larger product palette and the platform exists in multiple languages. [Saxo offers access to 31 stock exchanges](https://www.home.saxo/rates-and-conditions/stocks/commissions), whereas [Nordnet provides access to only 8](https://www.nordnet.dk/dk/marked/handelskalender).. Nordnet is in Danish only, but offers pension accounts. Since recently, both Nordnet and Saxo have ["Månedsopsparing"](https://www.nordnet.dk/dk/kundskab/academy/manedsopsparing/hvad-er-en-manedsopsparing) (Eng: Month savings). "Månedsopsparing" is not an account, but a service from that automatically invests each month an amount into an product(s) of your choice [without brokerage fees!](https://www.nordnet.dk/dk/kundskab/academy/manedsopsparing/hvad-er-en-manedsopsparing)

Regardless of which one you pick, you'll make a good choice with either one. Nordnet and Saxo both provide Aktiesparekontos and automatically report to SKAT.

### Stock Exchanges
When investing through platforms like Saxo or Nordnet, they're just facilitating access to many stock exchanges where the actual trading happens. Some Stock Exchanges of interest from a Danish viewpoint are:
