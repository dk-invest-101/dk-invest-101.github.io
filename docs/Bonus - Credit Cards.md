Credit Cards can offer a range of rewards to customers such as air miles, cashback on purchases (small percentage of the amount is returned to you like for instance 0,5%) or insurances. Using Credit Cards for daily expenses can be a part of your daily expenses saving strategies in some countries. A very attractive offer, so why does not everyone use them?

### History
The most common cards in Denmark are those called "Debit Card" or "Dankort", where the money is directly debited from your bank account. Credit Cards, on the other hand is borrowed money until the due date, which usually is the end of the month. This can become dangerous if you live paycheck to paycheck or have a record of beeing in debt, since you won't notice your daily expenses directly your bank account and might be in for a suprise at the end of the month that now you owe thousands of DKK. Moroever, you are basically taking out a "quickloan" if you fail to pay the credit card provider, since interest rates can be a staggering 20% per year. Hence, only use Credit Cards with clear concience and remeber to incalculate your debt when you're looking at your bank account.

Meanwhile, Credit Card providers also make a lot of money in some countries like the USA. Here, they can charge the shop a staggering 2% (not you) for each transaction, called interchange fee. That's why they are happy to give you all these rewards to make you spend more. In Europe, this is capped at 0,2% by the [_2016 Regulation on interchange fees_](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/de/MEMO_16_2162) to prevent shops offloading additional fees on you to cover credit card interchange fees. Due to this fact, high rewards as you might have heard of in the USA or other countries do not really exist in Europe, especially in Denmark since we on top of that have the Dankort.

Dankort is Denmark's own payment card without any incetivising practices such as insurance and rewards, with transaction fees lower than 0,2%. "Forbrugerrådet Tænk", an independent consumer organization that works to promote consumer rights, actively fights for the preservation of Dankort, something Financial Institutions have less of an interest in since they are not making a lot of money on them.

All of this makes Denmark an uninteresting market, with minimal competition for Credit Cards with reward programs. Just ask any danish person, most of them have only a Debit Card or Dankort and don't even know about Credit Cards with rewards.

### Best Credit Cards in Denmark
That said, there are however some few Credit Cards with rewards like air miles, cashback on purchases or insurances in Denmark.

Many danish banks offer premium credit cards, mainly a Mastercard Gold ([Danske Bank](https://danskebank.dk/privat/produkter/kort/mastercard-guld), [Nykredit](https://www.nykredit.dk/dit-liv/produkter/kort-betalinger/mastercard-gold/), [Nordea](https://www.nordea.dk/privat/produkter/kort/nordea-gold.html), ...), with a yearly price of up to 800 DKK depending on your customer status, that only gives you a travel insurance. Most also have a Platinum Mastercard, costing 1.500 DKK/year with better travel insurance coverage and airport lounge access. I'm using _Nordea Mastercard Gold_ for comparison, but it should be noted that the offering may vary from Bank to Bank. For instance, _Nordea Mastercard Gold_ insures you worldwide, whereas _Danske Bank Mastercard Gold_ only covers Europe. It's advsiable to check your banks insurance policies.

However, there are also **completely free** alternatives, that offer similar services and we feel should be more highlighted! You could save thousands of DKK per year by just using those cards.
