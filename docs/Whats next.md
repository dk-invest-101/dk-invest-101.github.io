**Congratulations on Your Financial Milestone!** You've achieved financial stability and made your first investment! But is this it? Do you also feel there are many more opportunities out there to increase your life savings?

Yes, there are! Here is what we recommend you do from here on in the following order.

### 1. Max out Aktiesparekonto
Max out your Aktiesparekonto with _iShares MSCI ACWI UCITS ETF USD (Acc) (IUSQ)_. This is the best move you can make early on due to the low taxes this account provides!

### 2. Aldersopsparing
Denmark has six types of pension schemes:
- **ATP**: Short for "Arbejdsmarkedets Tillægspension", this is a mandatory pension supplement for almost all workers in Denmark. You contribute to it via SKAT and you'll receive it automatically if you live in Denmark and have a NemKonto.
- **Folkepension**: This is the public pension, which includes a basic amount that is the same for everyone and a supplement that varies depending on whether you are married, living with a partner, or single.
- **Kapitalpension**: New "Kapitalpension" accounts cannot be created anymore, but if you already have one, you can choose to receive the entire savings at once or in parts.
- **Livsvarig livrente**: This is a _private_ pension savings plan that you pay into yourself. It provides monthly payments for as long as you live. It's also known as a lifetime pension.
- **Ratepension**: This is the most common pension plan. If you have a workplace pension, this is usually the plan used, where you (and possibly your employer) contribute a monthly percentage of your salary into it. The savings are paid out in fixed monthly installments over 10-30 years.
- **Aldersopsparing**: This is the replacement for Kapitalpension. You can choose to receive the entire savings at once or in parts.

The thing with [_Ratepension_ and _Aldersopsparing_ is that](https://skat.dk/borger/aarsopgoerelse-forskudsopgoerelse-og-indkomst/pension-og-efterloen/fradrag-for-indbetalinger-til-pension):
- Contributions to both are tax-deductible, with a limit of 63.100 DKK for Ratepension and 9.100 DKK for Aldersopsparing in 2024 
- Aldersopsparing has a max contribution of 9.100 DKK per year, where this limitation does not exist for Ratepension (but only until 63.100 is tax-deductible)
- Payments from both are invested to keep up with inflation
- Investments are only taxed at 15.3% following the inventory principle (DK: Lagerprincip) taxation

Do you see what we're getting at? This is another way to lower your investment taxes in Denmark. It is the best form of savings for long-term investments, alltough you can't access the money until you retire, which is usually around age 68 in Denmark. **We recommend setting up an Aldersopsparing account with [Nordnet](https://www.nordnet.dk/dk/tjenester/pension/aldersopsparing) and try to contribute the maximum amount each year (up to 9.100 DKK) by investing in _iShares MSCI ACWI UCITS ETF USD (Acc) (IUSQ)_ and enjoy the tax benefits!**

> **Note**    
> SAXO Bank does not offer Aldersopsparing accounts. Many banks offer Aldersopsparing accounts [[0.7 Costs of Investing#Costs associated with Investing | but charge custody fees]]. Hence why we recommend Nordnet in this case


### 3. Månedsopsparing
Got some money left to spare? You must be doing well!

The next step is to sign up for a _Månedsopsparing_ (Eng: Monthly Savings) service with SAXO or Nordnet. This isn’t a new account that you create, but a free service where you choose an amount to be invested each month in one or more ETFs or mutual funds of your choice.

> Not all EFTs or mutual funds are available to a _Månedsopsparing_ 

There are two advantages to this:
- You spread your investments periodically taking advantage of the _Dollar-Cost-Averaging_ strategy
- You don't pay any brokerage fee when investing with a _Månedsopsparing_. This is specifically interesting, because it nullifies the common belief that "Investing only makes sense with a large amount of money for the investing fees to be comparable minimal."

We recommend investing a monthly amount into either the _Danske Inv Global Indeks, kl DKK d (DKIGI)_ ETF, which has a yearly management fee of 0,40% and follows the _MSCI World Index_, or the _Sparindex INDEX Globale Aktier KL (SPVIGAKL)_ ETF, which has a yearly management fee of 0,50% and follows the _MSCI ACWI Index_.

Although these ETFs have higher management fees compared to our earlier recommendation, the _iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS ETF (Acc) (SXR8)_ with a yearly fee of 0.20%, **they offer several advantages**. They follow well-established MSCI indexes too but pay dividends (meaning a portion of the company's profits, not the ETF's increase, is distributed to shareholders like you), and are taxed according to the _Realisationspricipet_ (Eng: Realization principle), meaning you are only taxed when you sell, not annually. 

> **Why is a realization taxed ETF better for a _Månedsopsparing_ but not for an _Aktiesparekonto_?**
> An accumulating and inventory taxed ETF is great, but inventory taxes (DK: Lagerprincippet) can quickly eat up a portion of your profits. That's why we recommend them for low-taxed strategies like with Aktiesparekonto and Aldersopsparing which either way already are inventory taxed .
> Meanwhile, _Månedsopsparing_ doesn’t offer tax benefits; it only saves you from paying brokerage fees. Therefore, a realization taxed (DK: Realisationsprincippet) ETF is a better choice for _Månedsopsparing_.

#### How to create a _Månedsopsparing_:
1. Sign up for a _Månedsopsparing_ with either SAXO or Nordnet.
2. Choose your ETFs or mutual funds and the amount to invest.
3. Set up an automatic monthly deposit or a one-off deposit from your regular bank account to your SAXO or Nordnet account, from which the _Månedsopsparing_ will collect the funds.

You can always adjust your investment amount and the composition of your investments.

### 4. Stocks
Finally, it's time to talk about the big money! Are you ready?!

No, you're probably not. We're not trying to gatekeep stocks, but very few people can consistently achieve returns higher than those of ETFs. This involves constant buying and selling, readjusting, and staying up-to-date with the progress of the company and markets.

This is close a part-time or full-time job, essentially day trading. Some people hope to make a quick profit and become rich with stock trading or believe they can create their own portfolio that will outperform the recommended ETFs. However, remember: with greater profit comes greater risk, and if things go wrong, you can lose a lot of money, [like this guy](https://www.tvsyd.dk/horsens/han-mister-800000-kroner-i-sas-aktier). Unless you truly believe in the growth of a company, don't invest in stocks directly. The more you invest in individual stocks, the more you're essentially gambling—like walking into a casino and putting everything on red.

> Time in the market (long-term holding of ETFs) beats timing the market (day trading)!
