Just like on your salary, you have to pay taxes on investments. Generally speaking, all types of income are taxed, also known as _Income Taxes_. Denmark has a progressive tax system, which means that the higher the income, the higher the tax rate, i.e. more tax must be paid on the last DKK earned compared to the first DKK earned, after certain thresholds are reached. You have probably heard about the "Top-skat", meaning you pay 3% more taxes on the yearly income that surpasses 640.109 DKK. Income from your salary, pension or bonuses, is called _"Personal income"_ (DK: Personlig indkomst).

> **SKAT's positive list**  
> The SKAT's "positive list" is a list of specific funds that meet certain special requirements and are therefore taxed in a different category and thus can have lower tax rates.

Income generated from investments is generally referred to as _Capital Income_ (DK: Kapitalindkomst). However, Denmark actually categorizes this into three income types:
- **Aktieindkomst**: Income generated from these investments is taxed at a progressive rate. Profit, up to DKK 61.000 is taxed at 27% - thereafter, you will be taxed at 42%. A married couple can combine the total of their profit upper limit, resulting in a limit of 122.000 before being taxed at 42%. "Aktieindkomst" includes the following products:
	- Capital Gains from Stocks (profits from Stocks)
	- dividends from Stocks
	- Funds and ETF's that are on SKAT's positive list 
- **Kapitalindkomst**: All other investment income (e.g. interests generated from saving accounts) or products not on SKAT's positive list, are taxed as "Kapitalindkomst". Here, the total net amount of all of them is what you are taxed on, but is also affected by your "Personal Income". For example, if you've received +5.000 DKK interest from a savings account, but had to pay -1.000 DKK in interest for a bank loan, then you only pay taxes on 4.000 DKK. The rate depends on the net amount:
	- Positive net capital income up to 50.500 DKK is taxed at 37% - thereafter, you will be taxed at 42%
	- Negative net capital income is taxed at 25% or 33%.
- **Aktiesparekonto**: Sometimes referred to as _ASK_, this is a type of investment account available in Denmark. It allows you to invest up to 135.900 DKK in Stocks, Funds, and ETF’s that are on SKAT’s positive list with a preferential taxation of only 17%. You’re only allowed to have one Aktiesparekonto with any bank.

> In Denmark, there are three types off bank accounts    
> - **Current Accounts** (In Denmark these have many names: NemKonto, Girokonto, Lønkonto, HandelsKonto, Aktiedepot, InvesteringsKonto ...), that you can use to invest into stocks, ETF's,... or make normal bank transfers. Money in these accounts are known as to be liquid since they can be used anytime
> - **Savings account** (DK: Opsparingskonto), where the bank pays you an interest on the balance you keep there. Here, money might be stored away from some time depending on the conditions of the account
> - **"Aktiesparekonto"**, a special type of saving accounts for stock trading

### When do you pay taxes?
There are two options for when the tax is due:
- **Realisationsprincippet** (Eng: Realisation Principle): You pay tax when you realise a return, which means when you sell a share or receive a dividend. If you sell shares at a loss, you can offset the loss against your gains. "Aktieindkomst" is taxed using the "Realisationsprincippet", excempt ETFs.
- **Lagerprincippet** (Eng: Inventory Principle): Tax is paid on investments annually, regardless of whether they are sold. At the end of each year, the increase or decrease in the value of investments is calculated. If the return is positive, tax is paid. If the return is negative, a deduction is received, which can be offset against any profit next year. All "Kapitalindkomst", "Aktiesparekonto" and ETFs are taxed using the 'Lagerprincippet'

With that in mind, all "Aktieindkomst" are taxed after the "Realisationsprincippet", [except for ETFs or some accumulating investments.](https://sparindex.dk/hvordan-er-det-nu-lige-med-skat-paa-investering/). ETFs, "Kapitalindkomst" and "Aktiesparekonto" are taxed according to the "Lagerprincipet".

### How do you pay taxes?
When you invest in an **Aktiesparekonto**, taxes are taken care of automatically. Whenever you make money from your investments, taxes are deducted from your account. If you don't have enough cash to cover the taxes, the bank or platform may sell some of your investments or allow your account to go into negative balance to pay the taxes. You'll be notified if this happens and given time (usually 30 days) to add more cash to cover the shortfall. Even if you've already reached the accounts limit of 135.900 DKK, you can still add extra cash to cover taxes owed. [Saxo](https://www.home.saxo) is one example where you'll go into a negative balance and add cash to cover for taxes.

**Dividend** taxes are paid upfront. When you receive dividends, 27% (or more) of the amount is withheld by SKAT before the rest 63% (or less) of your dividend is refunded to your account.

All **non-Aktiesparekonto investments** are automatically reported to SKAT if you use a Danish bank or platform. Taxes are then generally collected in connection with the publication of your "Årsopgørelse" (ENG: Annual tax statement) during the month of March.

## Double taxation on foreign Stocks & ETFs dividends
Investing in foreign stocks or ETFs that offer dividends may lead to double taxation, meaning taxation occurs both in the country where the stock or ETF is registered and in your home country, Denmark in this instance. Each country has its own rules governing dividend taxation, making it crucial to understand the specific regulations of the country where the shares are registered.

Upon receiving dividends from foreign shares, you will **automatically pay** a tax percentage to the foreign tax authority of the registration country. If there exists a double taxation agreement, referred to as _dobbeltbeskatningsoverenskomster_ (DBO, also sometimes known as "dobbeltbeskatningsaftalerne"), between the country in question and Denmark, the dividend is taxed at a maximum of 15% in the registration country, with the remaining taxation (27% - 15% = 13%) conducted by SKAT. However, this does not imply that only 15% tax is deducted.

In some cases, countries like Germany deduct automatically 26.375%. In such instances, you are then required to reclaim those taxes, a process that can be overly complicated.

Hence, it is vital to consider dividend-paying stocks or ETFs from certain countries over others. Here are some examples:

The 0% dividend tax in Ireland is a significant reason why numerous ETFs are registered there, including the iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS (SXR8), traded on multiple stock exchanges such as XETRA Germany and XSWX Switzerland.

> **Note**  
> A stock or ETF can be traded in a different country than where it is registered. For example, the "_iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS_" ETF, identified by "_IE00B5BMR087_," is registered in Ireland but traded on various stock exchanges like SXR8 on XETRA (Germany) and CSSPX on XSWX (Switzerland). Don't assume a stock is registered where it's traded.
