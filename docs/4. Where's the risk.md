When you invest your money in the markets, there can be extra risks compared to just keeping your cash in the bank. These are called "market risks."

These risks can lead to big changes in the value of your money in a short time, and if you need to take out your money at the wrong moment, you might end up with real and permanent losses.

Every type of investment, even those that seem safe like saving accounts or government bonds, has some level of **risk** â€“ the chance that you could lose some of the money you've invested.

In general, if you want to generate a high income from an investment, you'll have to be ready to take on more risk. However, if you'd rather make sure you don't lose your initial investment, you'll need to accept earning less from the investment. The important thing is to choose a level of risk that you're comfortable with and that won't mess up your everyday finances or get in the way of your long-term saving goals. That's a crucial part of having a good investment plan.

This is why it's really important to do budgeting **before you invest any money**.
