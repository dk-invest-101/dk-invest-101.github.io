### I've just seen lots of hypes about a Stock online, and it increased massively within the 24h - if I'm not buying now, then it's too late?!

If you’re hearing about a hyped stock for the first time through online communities, like Reddit, it’s a guarantee that you are too late to ride any possible “wave”. These stocks are also commonly known as "meme stock", since they have no real tangible value or reason for their massive increase, except thousand of users blindly jumping on a train in hope of getting rich quick, or even just bots spamming. Weak hearted investors are pushed into investments out of fear of missing out the next GameStop (GME) or DogeCoin (Cryptocurrency) which have risen from mere cents to several dollars, yielding an increase of several thousand percent. The low prices of these stocks makes it even harder to resist buying into.

However, as time has proven over and over again, the majority of people _overwhelmingly_ lost money on their investments. Heck, "Bed Bath & Beyond Inc." (BBBY) went _bankrupt_ and no longer exists as a company. Do not use them as a source of financial advice.

If you take a closer look at the posts, most lack substance and just repeat hype and clichés. This is a clear sign they aren't worth taking seriously. If they had a real reason to believe these stocks were a good investment, wouldn't they say so? However, there may be some, that seem highly researched posts with some fake statements.

Here are some examples to give you a feeling of a hype avalanche:
- **Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc (FFIE) 05/2024**: Some reddit users started posting "analytic" researches about FFIE being shorted, similar to GME. Some examples, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/roaringkitty/comments/1cs8jvk/ffie_95_shorted_if_we_get_the_shares_and_hold/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/roaringkitty/comments/1ctqyyq/why_today_was_day_1_of_the_ffie_short_squeeze/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/roaringkitty/comments/1ct66kk/i_was_doing_my_research_to_see_if_ffie_is_worth/). After these kinds of posts have increased, thousands of investors jumped on the wagon and hence superficially increased the stock from 0,06 USD to 2 USD, increasing by 4000%. Some days later, the stock plumeted back to 1 USD. Imagine the losses when you jumped in at the peak hype.
