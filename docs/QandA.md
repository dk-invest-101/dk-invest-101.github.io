### I have now X DKK, what should I do with it?
Whether you've saved up a lot of money, inherited it, or come into it in some other way, it's important to handle it carefully. Take your time to adjust to your new financial situation and make decisions calmly and thoughtfully.

First, put the money in a bank account where it's safe. Then, **forget about it** and take time to plan your next steps. Spend enough time getting used to having the money and doing your research. Use resources like this wiki and talk to people you trust.

> If you don't trust banks, remember that most home insurance policies only cover up to 25,000 DKK in cash if it's stolen. So, it's probably safer to keep it in a bank.

While you're figuring things out, don't touch the money. Avoid buying things, telling people about your money, or start investing in whatever catches your eye thinking you are going to be the next Warren Buffett! Be patient and make well-thought-out decisions.

### Where to safely store large sums of money?
As mentioned in [9. Insurances](https://dk-invest-101.github.io/Insurances), if you have more than 100,000 EUR / 750,000 DKK, it's a good idea to split it and store it in multiple institutions to make most out of the Garantieformuen insurance. For example, you can use banks like Bank Norwegian and Lunar, which offer free accounts.

### I've just seen lots of hypes about a Stock online, and it increased massively within the 24h - if I'm not buying now, then it's too late?!
If you’re hearing about a hyped stock for the first time through online communities, like Reddit, it’s a guarantee that you are too late to ride any possible “wave”. These stocks are also commonly known as "meme stock", since they have no real tangible value or reason for their massive increase, except thousand of users blindly jumping on a train in hope of getting rich quick, or even just bots spamming. Weak hearted investors are pushed into investments out of fear of missing out the next GameStop (GME) or DogeCoin (Cryptocurrency) which have risen from mere cents to several dollars, yielding an increase of several thousand percent. The low prices of these stocks makes it even harder to resist buying into.

However, as time has proven over and over again, the majority of people _overwhelmingly_ lost money on their investments. Heck, "Bed Bath & Beyond Inc." (BBBY), a once hyped stock, went _bankrupt_ and no longer exists as a company. Do not use them as a source of financial advice.

Commonly, if you take a closer look at the hyping posts, most lack substance and just repeat hype and clichés. This is a clear sign they aren't worth taking seriously. If they had a real reason to believe these stocks were a good investment, wouldn't they say so?

### Invest a Large Sum All at Once, or Over a Period of Months?
Investing a large amount of money all at one time, known as a _"Lump Sum"_ investment, can be intimidating. What if the market drops by 5% the next day? Financial markets fluctuate, so it is often difficult to choose the best time to invest.

You might find it more comfortable to invest a set amount regularly over a period of time, no matter what the market is doing. This method, called _"Dollar Cost Averaging,"_ helps reduce the impact of short-term market changes by spreading out the cost of your investments. By buying over a period of time, you are purchasing stocks at the **average** price over the period, instead of one specific point at the start of that time period. This protects you from the stress of a big market drop right after you invest.

However, if the market goes up for a long time, you might miss out on some potential gains you would get with a Lump Sum investment. Despite this, Dollar Cost Averaging is a safer approach that might help you sleep easy at night. [Statistically, you are more likely to get a higher return with a lump sum investment.](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/news/lump-sum-investing-versus-cost-averaging-which-is-better)

### Why can't we buy some S&P 500 ETFs like Vanguards VOO?
As a retail investor (little fishes like you and me), we can't buy certain products, such as the _Vanguard S&P 500 ETF_ with the ticker symbol _VOO_, which [is highly recommended in U.S. investment communities.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1038v2m/ivv_spy_voo_what_is_the_best_sp_500_etf_tracker/).

The reason is that the European Union requires a [Key Information Document (KID)](https://www.nordea.fi/en/business/our-services/investments/kid.html) in the local language. This document provides a summary of information to help investors understand the nature and risks of the ETF or stock. Since there is no KID for the _Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)_, you can't trade it in the EU without hurdles.

Some banks bypass this requirement by asking you to confirm that you understand what you're doing.
SAXO requires you to take a test before allowing you to trade such products.

### About DK-Invest-101
We ourself have tried several times to start investing but kept giving up because there's a lot of confusing investing terms.

It's basically a one-stop-shop for anyone who wants to learn the basics, understand the costs and risks, and make low-risk investments for saving money for the future!

DK-finance-101 is run as an open source project with an aim to always be free and easy accessible. There are no intentions of ever monetizing this website.
