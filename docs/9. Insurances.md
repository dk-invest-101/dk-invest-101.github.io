If you made a bad investment choice, then that money is gone. However, in situations like your bank or investment platform going bankrupt, there are protections in place to recover some of your funds in both saving accounts and investments.

### Garantiformuen
After the financial crisis of 2007-2009, the European Union established the [Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGS)](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/banking/banking-regulation/deposit-guarantee-schemes_en). In Denmark, this is known as the ["Garantiformuen"](https://www.fs.dk/garantiformuen/om-garantiformuen) (formerly known as "Indskydergarantifonden")

Under this scheme, deposits in bank accounts are insured up to 100.000 EUR or 750.000 DKK per bank. If you have more than 750.000 DKK in life savings, it’s advisable to spread it across multiple banks to protect sums beyond the limit per bank.

### Protection for Investors
In the event that an investment platform like SAXO or Nordnet becomes bankcrupt, your investments are simply transferred to another platform (e.g. from Nordnet to SAXO). Remember, these companies act as brokers and the investments are registered elsewhere. There are, however, specific details to consider:
- **Danish Funds and Stocks** are registered in your name at _"Værdipapircentralen"_ (VP), the Danish registrar for ETFs and Stocks. Since these are registered in your name, you are the proven owner of these shares, and transferring them is not an issue.
- **ETFs and foreign Stocks** are registered differently. Given the global market's size, it would be a monumental task for Saxo or Nordnet to register each share in your name with the respective country's registrar. Instead, SAXO and Nordnet use partners (such as Citi Group) capable of managing these registrations. But when you purchase shares through SAXO or Nordnet, the shares are registered in the broker’s name, a practice known as "Street Name" where the broker holds the share on behalf of a client. If SAXO or Nordnet cannot locate or transfer your shares due to registration errors or other issues, your investments are insured up to 20.000 EUR or 150.000 DKK.

You could of course distribute investment over several platforms, just like life savings. However, you're limited to very few platforms that don't overcharge you for investments and that provide the convenience like SAXO and Nordnet do with for instance tax reporting or no custody fees.
That said, [SAXO has been enlisted as a _Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFI)_ by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority](https://www.em.dk/aktuelt/nyheder/2023/jun/saxo-bank-udpeges-som-sifi), which basically means SAXO is designated as "too big to fail" and the danish state will step in before the bank goes bankcrupt.
