title: 9. How to choose your ETFs & Stocks?

There are over dozens of factors that you should consider when picking an ETF or Stock:
- Underlying index and how the stocks are weighed (ETF only)
- Historical performance
- Tax efficiency
- Management fees (ETF only)
- Volume
- Liquidity
- Dividend
- ...

It's a lot of work analysing ETFs and Stocks. It's a bad idea buying blindly that someone else suggested. As you can see, this can become some overly complex territory when weighing all those considerations. Diversification is a fundamental principle in investment. However, achieving this diversification yourself with stocks can be overwhelming. For this reason, this guide will not delve into stock investments, as it is a more advanced topic. Subsequently, the typical wisdom is investing in ETFs that track some fairly safe indexes:

| **Index**                           | **Description**                                                                                                         |
|:----------------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| S&P 500                             | Tracks the top 500 large cap companies in the United States.                                                            |
| MSCI World Index                    | Tracks 23 developed countries (e.g. USA and Europe) of over 1,500 companies.                                            |
| MSCI Emerging Markets               | Tracks 24 Emerging Market countries (e.g. Indonesia and China) in five different regions and more than 1,400 companies. |
| MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI) | ACWI is a combination of the World Index and Emerging Markets.                                                          |
| MSCI Europe                         | Follows the largest stocks from 15 European Countries                                                                   |

Alright, before we dive into finding ETFs that track those indexes, let's take a moment to familiarize ourselves with some concepts and key terms that will help you distinguish between ETFs and stocks.


#### Identifier: ISIN & Ticker Symbols
The **ISIN** code is the individual paper's name or address. It is short for **International Securities Identification Number** and consists of a 12-digit code. You can use the ISIN code to look up a security. If you only have the name of the security, you may be left with many different ETFs to choose from. Many ETFs trade under the same name, yet are different. They can be by e.g. to be dividend paying or accumulating. They can also be traded in different currencies. By using an ISIN code, you are sure that you will find the right security. You can compare it with a security's **CPR number** or **number plate**.

A **ticker symbol** is a shorter and more precise abbreviation, since it identifies the ETF or Stock at a stock exchange level (e.g. NASDAQ USA or XETRA Germany).

For example, the "_iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS_" with ISIN "_IE00B5BMR087_" is traded on six stock exchanges. 
![](./assets/iShares-SP500-markets.png)

Its ETF has a different ticker symbol depending on where it is traded. In above's picture, "CSPX" exists twice, but these are then even further separated by the colon (:) separator followed by the stock exchange's code _"xetr"_ (XETRA Germany) and _"xams"_ (Amsterdam). 

#### UCITS
UCITS stands for Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities. It's a set of rules in the EU governing investment funds. These rules ensure funds diversify their investments, manage risks well, and limit exposures. They also regulate how UCITS can be marketed and sold to investors. The main aim is to increase protection for investors. This also means that the underlying assets are generally simple and therefore also easy to understand.

#### Class of Shares: A, B, C, D, ..., X, Y, Z? What do they mean?
These letters represent what's known as the "class of shares," indicating different types of company stock. Each class comes with its own set of voting rights and perks for shareholders, like dividend access. Companies often create different share classes to maintain control or to protect themselves from takeovers, and each share class will probably have different charges and different minimum investments

For example, Google's share structure includes three classes of stock: Class A, Class B, and Class C. Class A shares typically have one vote per share and are held by regular investors. Class B shares, primarily owned by the founders, carry higher voting power with 10 votes per share. Class C shares, usually held by employees, have no voting rights. This structure allows the founders to maintain control over major business decisions.

But here's the twist: there's no universal rulebook dictating what each class must offer. One company's class B shares may give different rights than a different company's.

#### Differentiating between similar ETFs
When looking for an _S&P 500_ ETF, you may find yourself overwhelmed by a dozen or hundreds of options:
- _iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV)_
- _iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS ETF USD (IUSA)_
- _Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)_
-  _iShares Core S&P 500 (Acc) UCITS ETF (SXR8)_
- _SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)_
... to name a few. This is quite common for ETFs, but not really Stocks.

However, why are there so many if all they do is track the same index?

Well, each one has different features — some might be cheaper, some might be easier to buy depending on where you live, and some might come with extra benefits like tax efficiency. The key differences can be:

- **Costs**: Some have higher management fees than others. For example, _SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)_ is at 0.0945%, which is more than triple _Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)_ or _iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV)_ rate of 0.03%.
- **Accessibility**: Some are designed for investors from certain countries or those who use specific currencies. For example, _iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV)_ is traded in the US or Australia in their local currencies (USD and AUD), whereas [_iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS ETF USD (IUSA)_](https://morningstar.dk/dk/funds/SecuritySearchResults.aspx?search=IE0031442068) is traded in Europe on German, British, Swiss and other countries in their local currencies (GBP, EUR, CHF).
- **Tax considerations**: Depending on where you live and where the ETF is based, you might pay different amounts of tax on your investment profits. For example, since _iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS ETF USD (IUSA)_ is on "SKATs positivliste", you pay a minimum of 27% (or 17% with an Aktiesparekonto), instead of 37%. Furthermore, the ETF is registered in Ireland, where ETF dividends are taxed at 0%.
- **Liquidity**: How easy it is to buy or sell the ETF. [Two primary indicators of liquidity are the ETFs trading volume and the spread ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/exchangetradedfunds/08/etf-liquidity.asp). For example, _iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV)_ has [a daily average volume trade volume of 5.5 Million with a spread rate of 0.01%.](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/ivv/quote), meaning it's easy to buy and sell it.
- **Accumulating or Dividends**: Some ETFs like _iShares Core S&P 500 (Acc) UCITS ETF (SXR8)_ are accumulating, others are returning the dividends to the investors like the _iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS ETF USD (IUSA)_.

From a Denmark viewpoint, the _iShares Core S&P 500 (Acc) UCITS ETF (SXR8)_ is a great option since it has:
- low costs of 0.07%
- traded on European Markets like XTRA (Frankfurt, Germany) and the danish currency always closely follows the Euro, meaning you are not risking high losses due to currency market changes like with USD
- on "SKATs positivliste", meaning you pay a minimum of 27% (or 17% with an Aktiesparekonto), instead of 37%.
- registered in Ireland with no additional ETF dividend fee
- is highly liquid
- accumulating, meaning gains are reinvested into the ETFs yielding probable greater returns in the future

#### Choosing an ETF (or Stock) that is traded on several Stock Exchanges
How to decide when a Stock or ETF is traded on multiple exchanges?
As we've seen with our "_iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS_" with ISIN "_IE00B5BMR087_", the ETF is traded on more than 6 stock exchanges.

You should choose the stock exchange with **the highest liquidity** and if the ETF or Stock pays dividends (accumulating included), then you should choose [the country with the best tax conditions.](https://github.com/dk-invest-101/DK-Investing-101/blob/main/0.6%20Taxes.md#double-taxation-on-foreign-stocks--etfs-dividends) 

If you're buying the ETF with a different **currency** from your investment account, the currency part doesn't really matter much. The conversion rate remains consistent with Saxo and Nordnet.

Although **Stocks and ETFs have a base currency**, they can be traded in various currencies without affecting their underlying value. For example, take the _"iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS"_ ETF, [which base currency is USD](https://www.ishares.com/uk/professional/en/products/253743/ishares-sp-500-b-ucits-etf-acc-fund?switchLocale=y&siteEntryPassthrough=true). If you buy it on the German stock exchange using Euros, its value will still mirror the movements of the US dollar, just as if you bought it directly on the Swiss Exchange, where it's listed in USD.


> **Fun Fact:**
> - [Danish Nationalbank keeps the DKK exchange rate fixed against the Euro at 1 EUR = 7,46 DKK](https://www.nationalbanken.dk/en/what-we-do/stable-prices-monetary-policy-and-the-danish-economy/learn-about-inflation-interest-rates-and-the-fixed-exchange-rate-policy)
> - Currencies are not bound to a stock exchange's location. For example, the "_iShares Core S&P 500 (Acc) UCITS ETF (CSSP:xswx)_", traded on the Swiss Exchange is traded in USD, instead of the country's Swiss Frank (CHF) currency.
