**DK-Invest-101** is a free guide for people new to investing. Each step is explained simply, so you donâ€™t need any prior knowledge.

We too struggled with investing due to confusing terms and resources that assumed we already knew a lot. After years of frustration, we finally got ourselves together and went through articles, guides, and websites. This inspired us to create a straightforward resource with simple language, focused on the Danish market and its rules. Itâ€™s perfect for anyone wanting to start investing!

We have no plans to monetize this website.
