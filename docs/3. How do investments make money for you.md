There are three main ways in which investments make money: **Interest**, **Dividends**, and **Capital Gains**:
1. **Interests** (DK: renter): Comes from investing in such products as savings accounts or bonds. The return is typically a fixed amount paid at regular intervals.
2. **Dividends** (DK: Udbytte): When you buy shares in a company, you may earn dividends, which are a portion of the companyâ€™s profits distributed to shareholders. Not all companies offer dividends, and those that do may not do so regularly.
3. **Capital Gains**: (DK: Kapitalindkomst) These are earned when the price of an asset like stocks, property, or other investments increases over time. You earn the profit when you sell the asset for more than what you paid for it.

Moreover, there's something called **Compounding**. Compounding is the process of earning interest on your investment, then reinvesting that interest. Over time, your original investment plus the interest from your investment starts to earn interest. It is important to start investing as early as possible to take full advantage of the power of compounding. ETFs that use compounding are known as "Accumulating ETFs".
